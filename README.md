# Pet Portal  

Duration: September 5th - September 20th 2022

The inspiration for this application are my two pet snakes, Gwyn and Patches!  Snakes are inconsistent eaters and thus I needed a way to keep track of when they've eaten or refused food. My application was built for a mobile device and is a feeding tracker for any type of pet. It allows you to add pets and assign them a pet sitter so you are able to view feeding details while out of town.
